Project to see if reinforcement learning (machine learning) can be used to automate penetration testing. 
I am looking for :
1. implementation of reinforcement learning 
2. check if it can help to automate penetration testing.
3. report (approximately 10,000 words)

The whole implementation can be done on virtual machines/cloud using a free NAS architecture/environment or any of your choice. 
Time: 1-4 weeks

we have to construct custom scenarios for penetration testing and measure the performance of attack policies generated by trined RL agents in those scenarios. There is already code of NAS simulator environment. u do not need to do that. 


========================================================================================================
Terms and Conditions:
1. Weekly update till I receive the complete project.
2. All source file for experimentation as I have to show it myself. I will replicate it in my system.
3. Complete report with references of 15000 words.
4. I will ask u few questions regarding the experiment implementation. And you will have to answer me.
5. Time deadline 26 March 2023.
6. Payment: 1200 AUD on instalments.
